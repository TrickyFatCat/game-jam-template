# About

This Godot project is a simple template project for game jams and rapid prototyping.

It contains the most common systems, which you can find in the majority of games. That's why I developed it to focus more on actual game systems and mechanics instead of working on common things like:

1. UI system;
2. Game manager;
3. Audio player;
4. Etc.

This project is simple and lightweight. It doesn't contain any particular mechanics like shooting or spawn.

However, you must check rules of a game jam before using this template if you can use some templates or not.

# Help and contribution

I'm not a professional programmer, and it's not trivial to make something like this for me. I will much appreciate any help and contributions, which can help to improve this project.

If you have some ideas about what to add or see that some parts of the project can be better, you're welcome!
